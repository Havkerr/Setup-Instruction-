Here's how you can structure a GitHub repository to document your project that includes implementing the Unity Insight XR SDK, integrating the XR SDK into a Solar System scene, and implementing a heatmap visualization using a particle system. Below are step-by-step instructions formatted as if they are README.md content for your GitHub repository:

# Unity XR Integration and Visualization Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Unity Insight XR SDK, integration of XR SDK into a "Solar System" project scene, and a heatmap visualization using the Particle System approach.

## Table of Contents
- [Unity Insight XR SDK Implementation](#unity-insight-xr-sdk-implementation)
- [XR SDK Integration in Solar System Scene](#xr-sdk-integration-in-solar-system-scene)
- [Heatmap Visualization using Particle System](#heatmap-visualization-using-particle-system)

## Unity Insight XR SDK Implementation
### Step 1: Setting Up Unity Insight XR SDK
1. **Open Unity Hub**: Start by opening Unity Hub on your system.
2. **Create or Open a Project**: Select the project where you want to integrate the Insight XR SDK.
3. **Install XR Plugin Management**: Navigate to `Edit > Project Settings > XR Plugin Management` and install it.
4. **Enable XR Support**: Choose your target platform (e.g., Oculus, Windows Mixed Reality) and enable the XR support for it.
5. **Add XR Packages**: Go to `Window > Package Manager` and add the Unity XR packages required for your device.

### Step 2: Configure XR Settings
1. **Configure XR Settings**: Adjust the XR settings to suit your hardware and performance needs.
2. **Test the Integration**: Run a simple scene to test if the XR environment is set up correctly.

## XR SDK Integration in Solar System Scene
### Setup Instructions
1. **Open the Solar System Scene**: Start Unity and open the Solar System project.
2. **Import XR Packages**: Ensure that all necessary XR packages are imported as mentioned in the previous section.
3. **Setup XR Interaction Toolkit**: Add the XR Interaction Toolkit by navigating to the Package Manager and adding it from the Unity Registry.
4. **Configure Interaction**: Set up XR Rig and interaction components such as controllers and hand presence.
5. **Adjust Scene Settings**: Ensure all scene elements are compatible with XR (e.g., scalable UI, interaction distances).
6. **Testing**: Test the scene with XR setup to ensure everything functions correctly.

## Heatmap Visualization using Particle System
### Implementation Steps
1. **Create a Particle System**: In Unity, add a new Particle System by right-clicking in the Hierarchy window and selecting `Effects > Particle System`.
2. **Configure Particle Properties**:
   - **Lifetime**: Adjust based on how long you want data points to be visible.
   - **Start Size**: Set depending on the intensity representation needed.
   - **Color over Lifetime**: Use a gradient from blue (low) to red (high) to represent data intensities.
3. **Scripting the Data Input**:
   - Create a script to handle data input and particle emission based on the data points.
   - Use the `ParticleSystem.Emit` method to create particles at runtime based on incoming data.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Test the heatmap in various conditions to ensure it accurately represents the data.
